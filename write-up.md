# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree : PID Controller Project Write-up

Compilation Criteria | Criteria to meet specifications
-------------------- | -------------------------------
Your code should compile. | Code must compile without errors with cmake and make.


Implementation Criteria | Criteria to meet specifications
----------------------- | -------------------------------
The PID procedure follows what was taught in the lessons.| The base algorithm should follow what's presented in the lessons.


Reflection Criteria | Criteria to meet specifications
-------------------- | -------------------------------
Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation. | Student describes the effect of the P, I, D component of the PID algorithm in their implementation. Is it what you expected? Visual aids are encouraged, i.e. record of a small video of the car in the simulator and describe what each component is set to.


Reflection Criteria | Criteria to meet specifications
-------------------- | -------------------------------
Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen. | Student discusses how they chose the final hyperparameters (P, I, D coefficients). This could be have been done through manual tuning, twiddle, SGD, or something else, or a combination!


Simulation Criteria | Criteria to meet specifications
-------------------- | -------------------------------
The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track. | No tire may leave the drivable portion of the track surface. The car may not pop up onto ledges or roll over any surfaces that would otherwise be considered unsafe (if humans were in the vehicle).
